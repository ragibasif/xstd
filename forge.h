/*Forge is a basic utility library, consisting of pure c functions that are
 * useful in any development. Forge is meant to be included in to all c files
 * and all other Quel Solaar libraries and applications. Because it is included
 * in all files it can provide some very useful functiuonality such as debugging
 * memory and help find memory leaks. Forge is designed to be lightweight and
 * compleatly platform and dependency indipendent.

/* ----- Debugging -----
If F_MEMORY_DEBUG  is enabled, the memory debugging system will create macros
that replace malloc, free and realloc and allows the system to keppt track of
and report where memory is beeing allocated, how much and if the memory is
beeing freed. This is very useful for finding memory leaks in large
applications. The system can also over allocate memory and fill it with a magic
number and can therfor detect if the application writes outside of the allocated
memory. if F_EXIT_CRASH is defined, then exit(); will be replaced with a funtion
that writes to NULL. This will make it trivial ti find out where an application
exits using any debugger., */
